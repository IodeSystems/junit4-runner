# junit4-runner

Allow JUnit4 to be run as a runtime feature, with XML reporting

This project follows the junit output guidelines (https://github.com/testmoapp/junitxml) in an attempt to create a
runtime junit4 test runner.

This is mainly for unhooking your build system from your testing framework, and allowing you to target production or
staging environments with tests.
